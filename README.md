This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Welcome to the "Pralinen Konfigurator"!

In this App you can virtually fill a praline box with pralines from a database.
The ingredient declaration and allergy traces are automatically displayed.

Try it and have fun!
